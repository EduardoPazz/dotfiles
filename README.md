# Fukuda's dotfiles

My configuration files for Linux. I try to keep all important configurations here as I frequently wipe my notebook, create servers and VMs but always like to keep things the same.

Here in this repository are configuration files for the following programs:

* alacritty (terminal)
* bash (Linux's shell)
* i3bar (status bar)
* i3 (window manager)
* starship (multi shell prompt)
* tmux (terminal window manager)
* vim (text editor)
* xorg-server (window server)
* xorg-xinit

And here is a list of some other programs I like to use with the ones mentioned above:

* autotools
* cmake
* d_menu (launcher)
* elinks (terminal browser)
* feh (for background image)
* firefox (browser)
* gcc
* git
* grub
* networkmanager
* openssh
* picom (window compositor)
* torbrowser (private browser)
* noto-fonts (special characters)
* ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols-mono (symbols)
