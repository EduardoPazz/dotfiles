# Fukuda's dotfiles

My configuration files for Linux. I try to keep all important configurations here as I frequently wipe my notebook, create servers and VMs but always like to keep things the same.

Here in this repository are configuration files for the following programs:

* alacritty (terminal)
* bash (Linux's shell)
* dmenu (launcher)
* git
* i3-gaps (window manager)
* i3status (status bar)
* networkmanager
* picom (window compositor)
* polybar (i3status alternative)
* rofi (dmenu alternative)
* starship (multi shell prompt)
* tmux (terminal window manager)
* tomb (encrypted files as device)
* vim (text editor)
* xorg-server (window server)
* xorg-xinit

And here is a list of some other programs I like to use with the ones mentioned above:

* autotools
* bat (cat alternative)
* cmake
* elinks (terminal browser)
* exa (ls alternative)
* fd (find alternative)
* feh (for background image)
* gcc
* grub
* keepassxc-cli (password manager)
* librewolf (browser)
* light (hardware brightness control)
* lxd (containers on linux)
* noto-fonts (special characters)
* openssh
* ripgrep (grep alternative)
* torbrowser (private browser)
* ttf-nerd-fonts-symbols-mono (symbols)
